     Welcome to the Tradable JS documentation. Tradable is an open API to easily build financial trading features into any app, through any brokerage. This is the documentation for the Tradable JavaScript SDK, which offers 2 kits:

     <ul>
          <li><b>core</b>: Lightweight wrapper of the Tradable API that will make the integration with it really easy.</li>
          <li><b>ui-kit</b>: See <a href='tradable-ui.html'>here</a> (optional)</li>
     </ul>

     <p>This site is a full specification with examples of what you can do with Tradable Core, but if you haven't had a look at it yet, we recommend reading the <a href='https://github.com/tradable/tradable-core#getting-started'>Getting Started</a> guide first.</p>

     <i>NOTE! The oauth flow doesn't work properly in this documentation site for the codepen examples, for the best experience please see the examples on Codepen.io, you can do that clicking on the "Edit on Codepen" link</i>
